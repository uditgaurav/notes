  ## What does this document do?
  Adding packet loss to the network
  Drops 7% of packets with 25% correlation
  ## Input Parameters
  * Interface: The interface to add delay to (default: eth0).
  * Loss: The percent of packet to drop (default: 7).
  * Correlation: The correlation - in percent - with previous packet loss (default: 25).
  * Duration: The duration - in seconds - of the test (default: 60).
  * InstallDependencies: If set to True, Systems Manager installs the required dependencies on the target instances. (default: True).

      ## Parameter: InstallDependencies
      If set to True, this step installs the required dependecy via operating system's repository. It supports both
      Debian (apt) and CentOS (yum) based package managers.

      ## Parameters: Interface, Loss, Correlation and Duration
      This step adds a `Loss` (in percent) to `Interface` for the given `Duration` (in seconds), using the `tc` (Traffic Control) command.
      The script will inject packet drop on the network, and wait for the given duration to remove that. It has two rollback mechanisms in place:
      * It will listen for exit signals (SIGINT and SIGTERM), and will stop the packet drop injection if any of them is received.
      * It will periodically enqueue rollback checks into a queue (using `at` command). This way, if the command is stopped and the rollback
      was not executed, the enqueued commands will try to stop it. (for example, if the command is stopped using kill -9). This is just
      and extra safety check to avoid the fault to remain injected after the script is no longer running.
